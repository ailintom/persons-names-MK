## Table: `publications`

### Description: 

__table_id: 2__  
Each record in this table describes a printed or online publication (a bibliographic entry). Here belongs everything published that can be cited using the author-year system.   
*Equivalent class: <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E31_document>*  
*Note:* On the back end, CSL-JSON bibliographical descriptions are converted into HTML bibliographical entries using [citeproc-node](https://github.com/zotero/citeproc-node). When the data are converted to a machine-readable format, CSL-JSON entries can be converted to [BIBO, also known as Bibliontology](http://bibliographic-ontology.org/specification) RDF, using [Zotero translation server](https://github.com/zotero/translation-server).

## Table: `inscriptions`

### Description: 

__table_id: 4__  
Each record in this table represents a physical object with an Egyptian inscription.

Objects originally belonging to the same structure that has a different type than the objects themselves (e. g., stelae originally installed in the same offering chapel) are considered different objects, but objects that are parts of an originally integral object of the same type, now decomposed, (e. g., two parts of the same statue, now stored in different museums) are considered the same object.
